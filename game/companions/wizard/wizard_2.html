            <pre class="story">As the wizard is mumbling you realise,
that you forgot to ask his name. You ask him quickly when he seems
to pause after reading.

He looks at you and says, "Of course, how could I forget to introduce
myself. My name is Archmage Ulozahl. Now lets get you to the city."

He takes a deep breath and starts chanting, 
"O dduwies hud, ewch Ã¢ ni i'n cyrchfan mewn amrantiad"

In a flash, you teleport to the city. 
Only to realise that you are many feet in the air.

You fall to the ground with a crash.

            <pre class="story">You walk towards the wizard, staggering due to your head injury.
The wizard looks at you, noticing the blood pouring out of the wound on your head,
which seems to be getting worse by the minute.

"Are you alright?", he says in a well spoken manner. "What has happened to you?"

You explain to him, that you woke up the in woods with no memory of what happened to you.

"I see", he says. "We will need to get you to a healer as soon as possible.
There's a priest in the nearby city. He would be able to help you.
I'll teleport us there. Just give me a moment."

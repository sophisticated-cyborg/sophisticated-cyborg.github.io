The warrior looks at you, noticing the blood pouring out of the wound on your head,
which seems to be getting worse by the minute. The smile drops from his face, 
he looks at you with a expression of great concern.
 
"Are ye alricht?" He says with a hearty tone. "Whit happen tae ye?"

"That's terrible", he says. "We need tae get ye tae a healer o' some sort. 
Theres one in the nearby city, A wis headin thare anyway,

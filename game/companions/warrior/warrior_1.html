            <pre class="story">Having agreed to go to the city with the warrior,
you walk along side him leaning on him for support as your head is beginning to 
get worse. 

"We canae gae on like this, here drink this.", he says as he hands you a strange
vial with a thick red viscious fluid in it. 
"It's a health potion, it'll help with yer head."

You drink it and suddenly as almost like magic, the pain in your head lessens.

"Thon'll only help for a while, we still neit tae get ye tae a healer."

            <pre class="story">You walk into the Tavern and look around. 
There is a warrior drinking and singing with a bunch of guards and citizens.
The warrior is a small round little man, with a long bushy ginger beard. 
He seems like a good person to drink with and an even better person to
fight alongside. 
<!--Looking around even more you spot a rogue, 
the rogue is a average sized woman, which has a mysterious aura to her. 
She is sitting in the corner of the room keeping to herself. 
Other patrons at the tavern seem to avoid being too close to her. 
There is a guard sitting at the bar watching her, 
it seems that people aren't too happy with her being here, you wonder why.-->
You then hear an arguement to your right, you see what appears to be the commander of
the barracks arguing with an old man. The old man is wearing long luxurious robes which
appear to be very expensive, he also has an amazing looking staff. This staff appears to
have a floating orb in the middle of it. You think to yourself that this old man must be
a wizard and that it might be beneficial to talk with him as he seems worried about something.

You decide to approach one of them. Which one do you choose?</pre>

            <pre class="story">You walk into the Barracks and look around. 
There is a ranger sitting with a few guards talking about recent attacks throughout
the woods. You wonder if this was what happened to yourself. The ranger stands up,
he is a tall man with blonde hair which goes down to his shoulders. He has a finely
carved longbow strung over his shoulder and a short sword on his hip. You look at his
ears and notice that they are pointy in shape, you realise that the ranger is an elf. 

You then hear an arguement to your right, you see what appears to be the commander of
the barracks arguing with an old man. The old man is wearing long luxurious robes which
appear to be very expensive, he also has an amazing looking staff. This staff appears to
have a floating orb in the middle of it. You think to yourself that this old man must be
a wizard and that it might be beneficial to talk with him as he seems worried about something.

You decide to approach one of them. Which one do you choose?</pre>

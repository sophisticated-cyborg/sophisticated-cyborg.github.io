            <pre class="story">Your journey begins, you waken in an unknown place with no memory of how you got there.
You look around you, you're in a clearing in the middle of the woods. 
You get a sudden sharp pain in your head, 
you raise your hand only to feel blood pouring from a wound on your forehead, 
you were knocked out by someone or something. 
You get yourself on your feet and look around for your potential assailant. 
You don't seem to see anyone around. 

You see a path leading up towards what seems to be a town, 
you head towards it to try and find out what or who might have attacked you
while you were out in the woods. When you reach the town you see cold and empty streets, 
there doesn't seem to be anyone that you can see in the streets. 
The town is unusually empty. You notice a tavern up the street to your right, 
there seems to be people in the tavern as you can hear them drinking and singing. 
<!--You then look left and notice a barracks with some town guardsmen posted outside the door.

Where would you like to go?--></pre>

Welcome to my website.

My name is Ryan. I'm a student at <a href="https://www.napier.ac.uk/">Edinburgh Napier University</a>. 

I'm studying Cybersecurity & Forensics. 

This website is a hobby as well as showcase of the projects that
I have worked on in my free time.

There is a choose-your-own-adventure game on this site, which was
a project for one of my university modules.
